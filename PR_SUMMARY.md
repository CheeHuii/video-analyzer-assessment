# Pull Request Summary

## Problem Statement
When running the video analyzer application, three console errors prevented functionality:
1. `getHistory failed - command get_history missing required key conversationId`
2. `send_message_and_stream missing required key conversationId`
3. `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded at onFileChange (UploadPanel.tsx:21:29)`

These errors caused:
- Chat history to fail loading on app start
- Messages to not send or receive responses
- Video uploads to hang at 10% progress

## Solution

### Files Modified
1. **frontend/src/grpcClient.ts** (4 lines changed)
   - Fixed parameter naming for Tauri v2 compatibility
   
2. **frontend/src/components/UploadPanel.tsx** (9 lines changed, 1 line removed)
   - Fixed stack overflow with chunked processing

### Technical Details

#### Fix 1: Parameter Naming
**Issue:** JavaScript was using snake_case (`conversation_id`) when calling Tauri commands, but Tauri v2 requires camelCase (`conversationId`).

**Solution:** Changed all invoke() calls to use camelCase:
```typescript
// Before
await invoke('get_history', { conversation_id: conversationId });

// After  
await invoke('get_history', { conversationId });
```

**Why:** Tauri v2 automatically converts between JavaScript camelCase and Rust snake_case. The JavaScript side must use camelCase.

#### Fix 2: Stack Overflow
**Issue:** Converting large files to base64 using `String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(data))` exceeded JavaScript's function argument limit (~65k-500k depending on engine).

**Solution:** Process file in 8KB chunks:
```typescript
const bytes = new Uint8Array(data);
let binary = '';
const chunkSize = 8192;
for (let i = 0; i < bytes.length; i += chunkSize) {
  const chunk = bytes.subarray(i, Math.min(i + chunkSize, bytes.length));
  binary += String.fromCharCode(...chunk);
}
const b64 = btoa(binary);
```

**Why:** Chunking ensures we never exceed the maximum argument count, allowing files of any size to be processed safely.

- Backward compatible

## Documentation
Three documents added to help understand and test the changes:

1. **FIXES_APPLIED.md** - Detailed technical explanation, testing guide, and background
2. **SECURITY_SUMMARY.md** - Security analysis confirming safety of changes
3. **PR_SUMMARY.md** - This file - high-level overview

## Next Steps for User

### 1. Test the Fixes
```bash
# Start backend
python main.py

# Start frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm run tauri dev
```

### 2. Verify Each Fix
- ✅ App starts without console errors about conversationId
- ✅ Chat history loads successfully
- ✅ Can send messages and receive responses
- ✅ Can upload videos without hanging at 10%

### 3. Expected Behavior
All three original error messages should be gone:
- No "missing required key conversationId" errors
- No "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors
- Application should work smoothly for chat and file uploads

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors:
1. Make sure you're on the correct branch: `copilot/fix-frontend-message-sending`
2. Verify backend is running: `python main.py` should show services started
3. Check frontend dependencies are installed: `cd frontend && npm install`
4. Clear browser cache if testing in dev mode
5. Check console logs for any new error messages
