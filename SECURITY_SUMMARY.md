# Security Summary

## Changes Made
This PR fixes frontend errors by:
1. Correcting parameter naming for Tauri command invocations
2. Implementing chunked file processing to prevent stack overflow

## Security Analysis

### Parameter Naming Changes (grpcClient.ts)
**Change:** Updated invoke() calls to use camelCase parameters (conversationId, base64Data)
**Security Impact:** None - purely a naming convention fix, no change to data flow or validation
**Validation:** All parameters are still validated by:
- Tauri's type system
- Rust function signatures  
- gRPC protobuf definitions
- Python backend validation

### Chunked File Processing (UploadPanel.tsx)
**Change:** Process file data in 8KB chunks instead of spreading entire array
**Security Impact:** Positive - prevents Denial of Service attack via stack overflow
**Benefits:**
- Prevents malicious users from crashing app with large files
- Maintains same base64 encoding algorithm (no security regression)
- No new attack vectors introduced
- Input size still limited by browser file picker and backend

### No New Dependencies
**Impact:** No new security surface area
- No new npm packages added
- No new Rust crates added
- No changes to Python dependencies
- All existing security boundaries maintained

### Data Flow Security
**Unchanged:**
- File uploads still go through Tauri's secure IPC
- gRPC still validates message structure
- Database queries still parameterized (no SQL injection risk)
- No external network calls added

### Authentication/Authorization
**Unchanged:**
- No changes to auth mechanisms
- Conversation ID scoping maintained
- File system access still sandboxed by Tauri

## Conclusion
The changes in this PR:
✅ Fix critical functionality bugs
✅ Improve robustness against DoS
✅ Introduce no new security risks
✅ Maintain all existing security controls
✅ Follow secure coding practices

**Recommendation:** Safe to merge - fixes improve stability without compromising security.
